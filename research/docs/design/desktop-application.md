# Windows V1 desktop application contract

**Locked direction, reconciled 2026-10-26; runtime and Windows E2E evidence n=0.** V1 is a proper Windows desktop GUI. CLI/TUI is not a V1 user product. Pi SDK/RPC/headless paths are internal integration/diagnostic surfaces. The [stack decision](../foundations/desktop-stack-decision.md) locks Tauri 2, Svelte 5/strict TypeScript, Vite 8, a Rust shell and Node 24 LTS hosting the [Pi-derived fused core](core-fusion.md). Exact compatible patches/build hashes are frozen in TD-11, not inferred from moving guides.

The renderer owns presentation and temporary interaction state. Rust owns window/native-dialog/IPC validation, packaged child identity and process lifetime. The Node engine owns model/session transitions, current grants, actions, receipts, verification and optional derived memory. One shared versioned contract crosses the boundary; no renderer database, Rust model loop, generic command passthrough or second journal is introduced. Credentials never enter renderer state, URLs, ordinary logs or exported profiles.

Use local compiled assets and explicit per-window Tauri capabilities/CSP. No remote page receives privileged IPC. Display provider/plugin/workspace/model text as data; previews cannot execute instructions or acquire grants. Do not expose arbitrary shell/filesystem/HTTP APIs directly to the webview. A user-selected cloud request is made by the qualified core adapter under its data policy, independently of frontend rendering.

## GUI workflow map

| Surface / task                              | Required visible behavior and failure states                                                                                                                                                         | Backend contract                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First launch/setup / TD-05/17/29            | Base-only and skip are defaults; selected Git-backed artifacts show exact dependencies, bytes/unknowns and install versus enable choices. No RAG/LSP/editor/model payload is preinstalled.           | I1 staged installation, profile configuration and no ambient loader activity.                                 |
| Workspace/task / TD-12/18/34                | Scoped workspace identity, task composer, streamed text/tool progress, interruption and final verified/unverified/uncertain states. Long content remains usable without losing authoritative events. | Current grant, run/action IDs, event cursor and snapshot-bound verification.                                  |
| Provider/profile/model / TD-30/33/35        | Multiple connections/profiles, independent role binding, requested/effective/ready distinction, next-turn versus cancel-and-switch. Auth/quota/load/unsupported states are distinct.                 | Versioned provider/profile/selection records and per-role egress; no implicit fallback.                       |
| Session list/tree/fork / TD-12/30/33        | Search/list without RAG, explicit ancestry/fork point, restore/resume, changed-workspace conflict and writer ownership. Fork does not pretend to clone files.                                        | Actual Pi entry ancestry, lease/epoch, workspace snapshot and reconciliation.                                 |
| Approval / TD-08/34                         | Target, arguments, data destination, grant scope and expiry visible; approve/deny/cancel stays correlated to the original request. Reconnect/changed args/revision makes stale approval inert.       | One-use request identity plus current engine policy at effect handoff, never renderer authority.              |
| Changes/evidence / TD-42/46                 | Plain text/diff and exact source/test receipts in the base. Optional Monaco is separately installed, with packaged workers/assets and no CDN. LSP/language services stay separate selections.        | Read/edit scope, source coordinates, snapshot/verification artifacts; no editor claim from file render alone. |
| Modules/plugins / TD-29/36/57               | Not-installed/off/starting/ready/draining/failed states, explicit trusted local/custom Git packages, update/rollback/remove with retained data and dependency owners.                                | I1/P1 install and lifecycle records; user-source files and external shared services survive removal.          |
| Memory/analysis/devices / TD-41/48/66/67/68 | Only installed features expose controls; citation/deletion/advisory/device-target states are truthful and independently disabled.                                                                    | Selected module gate, scope/epoch, actual provider/device and cleanup evidence.                               |
| Settings/support / TD-56/57/60              | Readable theme/keyboard/status/help, tested/unknown/unsupported distinction, local sanitized diagnostics/export controls. Viewing help executes nothing.                                             | Read-only typed projection; no secret/grant or support fabrication.                                           |

Every surface specifies initial, loading, empty, populated, validation-error, denied, unavailable, canceled, disconnected and recoverable-failure states where applicable. Keyboard focus order/restoration, accessible names, color-independent status, contrast, screen-reader behavior, text selection, window resize and high-DPI scaling belong to its acceptance criteria. MdSiddiqx reviews/tests every UI/UX PR; backend or IPC changes additionally require Itachi review.

The [frontend dossier](../frontend/README.md) refines composition, component/library choices, rendering and Windows acceptance. Codex is the workflow reference with complementary Claude patterns; Splyce owns original code/assets. TD-71–78 expand Dhanush/Shlok implementation under MdSiddiqx; the GUI consumes the same reviewed engine authority. TD-79 owns base session/artifact export/delete independently of optional memory.

Privileged Tauri application commands must be explicitly enrolled with `AppManifest::commands` and their capability permissions; registration with `invoke_handler` alone does not restrict them to a chosen window. TD-07 validates native caller/window/scope as well as argument schema. TD-50 and FUI-W9 require a real unprivileged bundled local webview to receive denial for every privileged custom command, with no effect.

## Native process, stream and restart contract

1. Start one owned packaged engine child after validating actual binary/source/build identity. Handshake protocol/schema/fork/runtime revisions and readiness before accepting a task; unsupported versions fail without auto-download/repair.
2. Use framed validated messages with request/run/session IDs and durable sequence/cursor. Bound message sizes and pending queues, apply backpressure, and retain recoverable authoritative events outside transient UI buffers. A dropped progress display cannot discard an action/outcome.
3. Commands distinguish accepted, started, canceled, completed, failed and uncertain. Responses correlate once; out-of-order/duplicate/stale messages do not mutate another session or impersonate success. Model/tool arguments are complete and validated before native dispatch.
4. Client/window closure and engine cancellation are separate. Prompt for the explicit active-run disposition; closing a window does not silently replay/cancel effects. Shutdown fences new dispatch, drains/cancels owned work, records survivors and closes owned children/connections.
5. After hard kill/restart, reconcile store, process identity and uncertain effects before resume. A stale writer/approval/profile cannot acquire continuing authority. Missing model/package/credential is a visible blocked role, with original evidence retained.
6. Import, deep links, file-open requests and dropped files are untrusted input: validate scope and present the requested action; never auto-run code, install a package or submit a provider request from their presence.

These are proposed shared contracts, not existing Tauri command names. Use actual Tauri command/channel and Pi SDK APIs after the task's source check. Do not implement another general RPC framework or an unrestricted public localhost service for the desktop bridge.

## Windows acceptance and release

V1 release support is **Windows only**. TD-11 fixes advertised Windows version/architecture/WebView2/runtime cells and installer preparation; untested combinations are unsupported. Linux/macOS remain research/future ports, not required V1 deliverables. Count installer/download/unpacked bytes for the app, WebView provisioning, Node/Pi, native dependencies, optional artifacts and models separately; measure cold/warm startup, idle/peak memory/CPU and full-task quality. No fixed MB/RAM/speed superiority is claimed.

Required future cases: `D1_base_setup`, `D2_provider_profile_switch`, `D3_approval_revision`, `D4_session_resume_fork`, `D5_child_crash_reconnect`, `D6_optional_install_remove`, `D7_workspace_verify`, `D8_accessibility_dpi`, `D9_import_no_execution` and `D10_installed_upgrade_uninstall`. Each runs the actual packaged Tauri application with the real fused engine/store and physical fixture workspace. Include denied effects, interrupted installs/streams, failed persistence, lost outcomes and user-selected local/cloud paths. Fixtures must fail when the behavior is removed.

Use WebdriverIO with the qualified Tauri service/driver on Windows, actual webview screenshots and native accessibility checks. Browser/component tests and mocked IPC help diagnosis but cannot certify desktop E2E. For the direct external-driver route, match the Edge/WebView driver version; qualify the embedded service route separately. Keep test-only automation permissions out of release builds and prove the release artifact preserves the tested runtime/authority behavior. Actual provider/device claims require separate authorized real-service evidence; deterministic transports establish fault behavior only. AGENTS forbids opening any PR with failed/unrun applicable E2E; documentation-only scope uses the existing documentation pipeline and explicitly records runtime E2E as N/A.
