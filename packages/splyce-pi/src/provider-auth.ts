// TD-16 � credential resolution port (INTERFACE-FIRST, v0).
//
// Types and invariants only; the native implementation follows. Provider
// adapters (TD-19..23) code against `CredentialResolver` and never see how a
// secret is stored, refreshed or redacted.
//
// Invariants every implementation must hold (TD-16 definition of done):
//  1. Import/discovery of a credential reference executes no helper.
//  2. A secret is resolvable only for the admitted endpoint/egress policy of the
//     provider connection; refresh cannot evade that policy.
//  3. A secret never appears in config, persistence, errors or normal artifacts;
//     it only exists inside `SecretLease.use`.
//  4. Unavailable/denied auth throws CredentialError. It NEVER selects another
//     provider, model or credential (no implicit fallback).
//  5. A command-valued helper needs its own C2 decision and a durable intent
//     BEFORE it is spawned, and an observed outcome/cleanup after.
//  6. A canceled or revoked lease cannot cache or later return late output.
