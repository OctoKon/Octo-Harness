// TD-25 / C3 recovery (interface-first prep). Pure reconciliation of the durable journal after a crash or an explicit
// engine Restart. It decides; it does not write, spawn or dispatch. The caller applies `corrections` through the
// store and shows `uncertain` to the user.
//
// Rules this module pins (plan row TD-25):
//   - an effect that may have started is never replayed: recovery has no "redispatch" output at all;
//   - an action may be `completed` only with an observed-success outcome; anything else is corrected, never invented;
//   - an interrupted run with a possibly-started effect becomes `uncertain`, not `failed`;
//   - a workspace cannot be taken over while any writer may still be alive, or has uncertain actions, even after its
//     lease expired or its client disconnected; only an explicit "not alive" answer releases it;
//   - after Restart nothing is admitted until reconciliation has been applied (`admissionOpen`).
