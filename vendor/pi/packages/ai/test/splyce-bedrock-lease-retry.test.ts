// TD-22 / C4: a leased Bedrock send must make exactly one physical request.
//
// The leased identity is memoized per client (@aws-sdk/core wraps the provider in
// @smithy/core memoizeIdentityProvider, which never re-invokes a provider whose identity carries no
// expiration), so a retry inside one send reuses the first lease. That is only acceptable if the leased
// path never lets the SDK send a second request on its own: a mid-send revocation must not be followed by
// an unauthorized send, and a revoked lease must not be skipped by a transport-level retry either.
//
// The fixtures in splyce-credentials-bedrock-azure.test.ts replace the SDK client, so they cannot count
// physical requests. This runs the real @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime against a loopback HTTP endpoint.
